# **Hospital Management System (HMS)**

This project is a simple **Hospital Management System** implemented in **Java** using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It manages essential hospital operations such as patient records, doctor details, staff information, and appointment scheduling.

The system demonstrates core **OOP concepts** including **classes**, **objects**, **inheritance**, **polymorphism**, and **encapsulation**.

## 🧱 **OOP Concepts Demonstrated**

* **Encapsulation** — data hiding through classes and private fields
* **Inheritance** — shared properties between user roles (Admin, Doctor, etc.)
* **Polymorphism** — method overriding in role-specific classes
* **File handling** *(if included in your version)*
